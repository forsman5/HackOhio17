# HackOhio17
This project was developed by Zach Allegretti, Joe Forsman, Jack Plank, and Sean Vactor at HackOhI/O 2017.

It is designed to program a raspberry pi zero with a camera module, ideally mounted to a pair of eyeglasses
or on a shirt pocket, to take pictures or videos at the press of a button, and save them to an SD card.

The Hack2017 folder is an android studio project used to create a companion app for a phone that connects via bluetooth.
The PiScripts folder is all the python (and some other language scripts) that live on the harddrive of the raspberry pi
	(in the startup folder of the pi)
